<hr />
<p>Hi, my name is Misba Medvedeva and I live in Portugal together with my husband and children.<br />
I am a housewife/stay-at-home-mother who likes to learn new thing every time.<br/>
Since recently I have had more opportunity to start spending more time on myself. <br />
Which does not only mean time to relax and take care of my skin, but also time for self-growth. <br />
To learn new skills and to push myself further to be a better version of myself. <br /></p>

<p>I have learned quite a few things since my youngest has become a little more independant. From crocheting <br /> 
to jewelry-making, to baking, and now webdevelopment! Learning new things, understanding how and why <br />
tings are the way they are, really gives you that feeling of accomplishment and confidence in the fact <br />
that by setting some time apart and by being consistent, you can definitely achieve your goals.</p>
